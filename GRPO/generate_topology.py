You are an expert in designing Multi-Agent Systems (MAS).

A MAS consists of multiple large language model-based agents collaborating to solve a task. The MAS is represented as an **directed graph**, where each node is an agent, and edges indicate communication links.

**Collaboration process:**
- In **Round 1**, each agent independently generates an initial response to the task.
- In **Rounds 2 and 3**, each agent observes the previous-round responses of its **direct in-neighbors** and updates its answer accordingly.
- After **Round 3**, the final answer is determined by **majority voting** among all agents' current responses.

**Perturbation and resilience:**
Each agent has a probability **p** of generating a **random answer** in each round. The MASâ€™s **resilience** is defined as the **average performance drop** under perturbations with p = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8. A **smaller drop** indicates **better resilience**.

**Your task:**
Design a MAS topology that achieves high resilience and accuracy **under a cost constraint**:
- You are given:
  - Number of agents **N**
  - Number of directed edges **M**
  - A specific task description
- You should output the MAS structure as an **adjacency list** with exactly N agents labeled **1 through N**, and **M edges**.

**Task description:**
{task_desc}

**Example task input:**
"{task_example}"

**Output format:**
Provide the MAS design as a **JSON adjacency list** in the following format:
{{"1": [2, ...], "2": [...], ...}}

**Examples:**
Here are some examples of adjacency list and their performance on some tasks.

1.
Task: The task is to predict a valid chess move given previous moves in a game.
Constraints: N = 10 agents, M = 18 edges
Adjacency list of MAS: {{'1': [2, 5, 9], '2': [1, 3], '3': [2, 4, 6, 7], '4': [3], '5': [1, 8], '6': [3, 10], '7': [3], '8': [5], '9': [1], '10': [6]}}
Accuracy: 0.406
Resilience: 0.812

2.
Task: The tasks are math problems sourced from competitive events and expressed in LaTeX, which are used to assess proficiency in advanced mathematical and scientific reasoning.
Constraints: N = 10 agents, M = 32 edges
Adjacency list of MAS: {{'1': [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10], '2': [1], '3': [1, 4], '4': [1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10], '5': [1, 4, 7, 9], '6': [1, 4, 7], '7': [5, 6, 8], '8': [4, 7], '9': [1, 5], '10': [1, 4]}}
Accuracy: 0.695
Resilience: 0.865

3.
Task: The tasks are challenging, reasoning-focused multiple-choice questions with 4 to 10 options, which assess language comprehension and reasoning ability across diverse domains.
Constraints: N = 10 agents, M = 16 edges
Adjacency list of MAS: {{'1': [5], '2': [6, 9], '3': [], '4': [6], '5': [1, 8], '6': [2, 4, 7], '7': [6, 9], '8': [5, 10], '9': [2, 7], '10': [8]}}
Accuracy: 0.695
Resilience: 0.872

Now please design a MAS topology under the following constraint.
**Constraints:**
- N = {num_agent} agents
- M = {max_edge} edges

Ensure the graph is adheres to the node and edge limit. Note that edges from node A to B and from B to A are considered as two edges. A node should not be connected to itself.
You should only output the json without any other words.
